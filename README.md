## Project Challenge - Relational Model into Dimensional Model (Star Schema)

Using the Relational Model image provided by the instructor, we were directed to convert it into a Dimensional Model, specifically the Star Schema, as was previously taught in previous classes.

### Original Schema - Relational Model

The instructor made it clear that the entity "professor" was to be the one made into the Fact Entity, leaving to the student as to what attributes would it be composed of, as well as the dimensions surrounding it. Some changes had to be implemented, entities and relationships scrapped, since they weren't needed for the model.
